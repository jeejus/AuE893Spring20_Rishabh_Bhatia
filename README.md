The assignment has 3 files namely
	1. circle.py (part1 of assignment2)
	2. constant_square.py (part2 of assignment2)
	3. variable_square.py (part3 of assignment2)

All of these are located in

1.circle.py: traces out a circle of constamt radius

2.constant square.py: traces out a square of fixed dimensions. It simply runs the turtle bot for a certain time aling X direction and then rotates it by 90 degrees. This is done in a for loop 4 times to achieve a square.

3.variable_square.py: traces out a square with starting point as 5,5. The turtle first goe to 5,5, then rotates anti-clockwise until it's direction matches with X axis. Then a similar code to constant_square.py is run which traces out a square of fixed dimensions.
